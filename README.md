# diagnosing-pneumonia

## Introduction

As the data analytics Ironhack bootcamp comes to an end, we are faced with the task of developing our final projects, where we work on some of the skills learned during the past seven weeks. One of these skills is training neural networks to classify images, which is the primary objective of this project. Through supervised learning, I will develop a deep learning model that takes chest X-rays and diagnoses pneumonia.

As a starting point for this project, I have used a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) containing almost 6,000 X-Ray images (JPEG) divided into 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).


## Libraries used

During the project, I have used the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Keras
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- os

```
- Data agumentation - Keras or _____
- User imput trough API post - Flask
- 'GUI' - PyQt5
- Email report - PyQt5 
```
